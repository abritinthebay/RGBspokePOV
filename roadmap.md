Project Roadmap
=============
This file is a broad brush as to the goals of the project, it is not to be taken as gospel or a hard and fast plan or restriction.

v0.1 - Initial code from Jan Paul's PimpMyBike project.

v0.3 - Original code is documented and commented so it is more understandable (to people other than Jan Paul!)

v0.7 - Recommended component list is finalized (inc. best LEDs) with sources.

v1.0 - Project is able to download, built, and used by someone at an equivalent level of skill to who is could do the same with LadyAda's SpokePOV project.

v1.5 Performance upgrades (if possible), improve Java Client (or rewrite it if that's a better plan).

v2.0 - Animation support (limited number of frames, would be nice to have the 4 of SpokePOV at a minimum). Possibly board shape improvements (e.g. - the slightly more stable 'hockey stick' shape).
